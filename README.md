# Minimal boilerplate for Next.js
I created this as a generic template for all of my web projects, so I've only implemented the tools I need to launch a new project.

- TypeScript on strict mode
- Next.js for SSR and static page generation
- React as my web framework of choice
- TailwindCSS for the convenience of inline styling
- ESLint using Airbnb style guide
- Prettier for automatic style formatting
- Postcss with autoprefixer plugin
